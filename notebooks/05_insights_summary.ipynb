    "# Final Insights & Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Insights\n",
    "1. Academic performance (CGPA) is positively associated with placement outcomes.\n",
    "2. Internship and training participation show strong alignment with placement success.\n",
    "3. Communication skills appear to significantly influence interview outcomes.\n",
    "4. Students with academic backlogs face lower placement probabilities.\n",
    "5. Certain academic streams consistently outperform others in placement rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "### For Students\n",
    "- Prioritize internships and practical exposure early\n",
    "- Improve communication and interview skills alongside academics\n",
    "- Address academic backlogs proactively\n",
    "\n",
    "### For Institutions\n",
    "- Encourage structured internship programs\n",
    "- Provide communication and interview preparation training\n",
    "- Identify at-risk students early using academic indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "- Dataset size and composition may limit generalizability\n",
    "- Some variables are self-reported and subjective\n",
